# Hive for Enterprise

Hive is designed to be the most secure, high-performance AI platform for professional teams. While Hive is free for individuals and small teams under the [Business Source License (BSL) 1.1](../LICENSE), we offer **Commercial Licenses** and **Enterprise Support** for larger organizations.

## Why Hive Enterprise?

Large organizations have unique security and compliance requirements that "wrapper" AI apps cannot meet. Hive's native Rust architecture provides:

- **Zero-Trust Security:** With HiveShield, PII and secrets are intercepted at the binary level before they ever reach an AI provider.
- **Performance at Scale:** A sub-50MB memory footprint means Hive can run on virtualized desktops (VDI) and older hardware without lag.
- **Auditability:** Every action taken by the Queen and her Swarm is logged locally in an encrypted SQLite database for compliance reviews.
- **Local-First Infrastructure:** Run Hive entirely behind your firewall using Ollama or LM Studio for 100% data sovereignty.

## Enterprise-Only Features

### 1. Centralized Policy Management

Deploy custom HiveShield rules across your entire organization. Block specific proprietary keywords or internal project names from ever being sent to cloud LLMs.

### 2. Team Memory Sync

While individual Hive instances use local collective memory, the Enterprise version allows for a **Shared Knowledge Base** where agents can learn from the accepted patterns of your entire senior engineering team.

### 3. Custom Agent Personas

We help you build and deploy specialized "Expert Agents" (Legal, Compliance, DevOps) tailored to your company's specific internal APIs and documentation.

## Get a Commercial License

If your organization has more than 10 employees or exceeds $1M in annual revenue, a **Commercial License** is required to continue using Hive in production.
